# Contact Tracer with Ruby on Rails

This Contact Tracer is a simple Web Application that keeps records of visitors to Tapir Grocer. It was completed within 3 days where I had no prior experience with web development. It was a challenge for myself to learn the fundamentals of MVC in web dev as preparation before my internship.

## Features
* Check in
* Capture information
* Input validation

## Prerequisite
The server is set up with Ruby on Rails framework. My Ruby version : ruby 2.7.2p137

## How to Run
1. Download code
  * Click "code", then select "Download ZIP" option.    
2. Unzip the file
3. Change path at CLI
  * Open Windows command prompt.
  * Change the default path to the unzipped file's path by typing "cd Downloads\rails-contactTracer-master\rails-contactTracer-master"
4. Start Rails server
  * Continue from the CLI session earlier, start up Rails server by typing "rails server".
5. Run the Web App
  * At the browser, type "localhost:3000"*
  * You should be able see the Tapir Grocer Index Page now.

_*Note: if port 3000 has been used, then please change to a different port number at the Rails server configuration and restart the Rails server._
