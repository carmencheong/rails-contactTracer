# Contact Tracer with Ruby on Rails

This Contact Tracer is a simple Web Application that keeps records of visitors to Tapir Grocer. It was completed within 3 days where I had no prior experience with web development. It was a challenge for myself to learn the fundamentals of MVC in web dev as preparation before my internship.

## Features
* Check in
* Capture information
* Input validation

## Prerequisite
Set up your server (could be a laptop) with Ruby on Rails framework. My Ruby version : ruby 2.7.2p137

## How to Run
1. Download code
    1. Click "code", then select "Download ZIP" option.    
2. Unzip the file
3. Change path at CLI
    1. Open Windows command prompt.
    2. Change the default path to the unzipped file's path by typing "cd Downloads\rails-contactTracer-master\rails-contactTracer-master"
4. Start Rails server
    1. Continue from the CLI session earlier, start up Rails server by typing "rails server".
5. Run the Web App
    1. At the browser, type "localhost:3000"*
    2. You should be able see the Tapir Grocer Index Page now.

_*Note: if port 3000 has been used, then please change to a different port number at the Rails server configuration and restart the Rails server._
